        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including storage, processing power, and
            applications, over the internet (the cloud) on a pay-as-you-go basis. Rather than owning physical hardware
            or running software applications on a local server or personal computer, cloud computing allows users to
            access resources remotely through the internet.</p>

    <div class="function">
        <h2>Function of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <img src="Cloud.jpg" alt="" id="image-left">
        <ol id="olf">
            <li><b>Data Storage:</b> </li>
            <p>Cloud computing provides scalable and reliable storage solutions for organizations to store vast amounts
                of data. Users can access their data from anywhere with an internet connection, facilitating
                collaboration and data sharing.</p>
            <li><b>Data Processing and Analytics:</b> </li>
            <p>Cloud platforms offer powerful computing resources for processing and analyzing large datasets.
                Organizations can leverage cloud-based data analytics tools and services to derive insights, make
                data-driven decisions, and optimize business processes.</p>
            <li><b>Compute Power:</b> </li>
            <p>Cloud computing platforms offer virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) and
                containers, enabling users to run applications, perform computations, and execute tasks without
                investing in physical hardware.</p>
            <li><b> Content Delivery: </b></li>
            <p>Cloud-based content delivery networks (CDNs) distribute content, such as web pages, videos, and software
                updates, to users around the world with low latency and high availability. CDNs cache content on servers
                located closer to end-users, improving performance and reducing bandwidth costs.</p>
            <li><b> Development and Testing:</b> </li>
            <p>Cloud platforms provide developers with scalable infrastructure and development tools to build, deploy,
                and test applications more efficiently. </p>

    <div class="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <img src="Advantages-of-Cloud-Computing1.png" alt="" id="image-left">
        <p> One of the primary advantages of cloud computing is its cost-effectiveness. Businesses can reduce their
            capital expenditure by avoiding the upfront costs of purchasing and maintaining physical hardware. With
            cloud computing, you typically pay only for the resources you use on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis,
            which can result in significant cost savings over time.
            Cloud computing provides unparalleled scalability, allowing businesses to easily scale their resources up or
            down according to their changing needs. Whether you need to accommodate seasonal spikes in traffic, handle
            sudden increases in workload, or scale down during quieter periods, cloud services can quickly adjust to
            meet your requirements without any disruption to operations.
            Cloud computing enables users to access their applications and data from anywhere with an internet
            connection, using a variety of devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets. This flexibility supports
            remote work, collaboration among distributed teams, and enhances productivity by providing access to
            resources on the go.
            Cloud service providers typically offer robust infrastructure with high availability and redundancy across
            multiple data centers. This ensures that your applications and data remain accessible and operational even
            in the event of hardware failures or disruptions. Service level agreements (SLAs) often guarantee uptime,
            providing assurance of reliability for critical business operations.
            While security concerns are often raised with cloud computing, reputable cloud service providers invest
            heavily in security measures to protect their infrastructure and customer data. They implement advanced
            encryption, access controls, and security monitoring to safeguard against unauthorized access, data
            breaches, and cyber threats. Additionally, cloud providers often comply with industry regulations and
            standards, further enhancing data security and compliance.</p>
